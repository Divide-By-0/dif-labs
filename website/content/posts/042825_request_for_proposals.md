DIF Labs is launching Beta Cohort 2 to drive focused, high-leverage work at the intersection of identity, trust, and emerging technologies. This cohort emphasizes not just experimentation, but building projects that can be maintained and extended over time.

We are seeking proposals from builders, researchers, and collaborators passionate about decentralized identity, cryptography, authenticity, and verifiable AI.

Successful applicants will receive mentorship, ecosystem support, and opportunities to collaborate with leading initiatives in decentralized infrastructure.

The full proposal process is outlined here: [DIF Labs Proposal Process](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/labs/blob/main/docs/process.md#operating-process).

## Focus Areas

We encourage proposals aligned with one or more of the following tracks:

### Personhood Credentials
Scalable, privacy-preserving systems for verifying human identity in decentralized environments.

### Content Authenticity and Assertions
Tooling and frameworks to verify the authenticity of digital content and fight misinformation.

### Applied Cryptography
Advancement of cryptographic tools critical to decentralized identity.

### Verifiable AI
Mechanisms for verifying AI-generated outputs, ensuring transparency and trust.

### Industry-Aligned Applications
Practical decentralized identity solutions in areas like Industrial IoT and operational privacy.

> If you are working on a different focus area that you believe is relevant, please reach out to the Labs Chairs to discuss before submitting.
